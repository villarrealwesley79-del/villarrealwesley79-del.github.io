## Architecture Decisions
- Use Hugo static site generator for efficient rendering and deployment.
- Utilized YAML files for global configuration settings, ensuring flexibility and ease of management.
- Integrated AdSense and Google Analytics directly into the HTML templates for real-time analytics.

## Naming Conventions
- File names follow a pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-article.md` in `/content/posts/`.
- Configuration files use `.yaml` extension with camelCase keys (e.g., `siteConfig.yaml`).

## Key Patterns
- Data flow is straightforward; content authored in markdown and transformed via Hugo templates into HTML.
- API design minimal, using standard HTTP requests for analytics services.
- State management handled through server-rendered content and client-side JavaScript hooks.

## Gotchas & Warnings
- Ensure all external links (like Etsy or Amazon) are correctly updated with affiliate disclosures as per the latest commit 8a28b68.
- Pay attention to SEO practices by maintaining proper metadata in markdown files, especially title tags and descriptions.

## Open TODOs
- Review and update AdSense settings after testing (`AdSense ca-pub-*`).
- Add more articles on financial planning tools and resources.
