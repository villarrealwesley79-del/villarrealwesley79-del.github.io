you.","keywords":["personal-finance","excel","budgeting","debt"],"articleBody":"If you’re carrying debt — credit cards, car loans, student loans — spreadsheets are your secret weapon. Not because numbers are fun, but because seeing the truth is the first step to changing it. These five Excel formulas take the guesswork out of debt payoff and show you exactly where you stand.\nNo finance degree required. Just Excel (or Google Sheets — these work in both).\n1. PMT — Figure Out Your Monthly Payment What it does: Calculates the fixed monthly payment needed to pay off a loan in a set number of months.\nFormula:\n=PMT(rate, nper, pv) rate = monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12) nper = number of months to pay it off pv = present value (the loan amount, as a negative number) Example: You owe $8,000 on a credit card at 22% APR. You want it gone in 24 months.\n=PMT(22%/12, 24, -8000) Result: $417.33/month\nUse this formula to reality-check any payoff plan. If that number is too high, stretch the timeline — but watch how much more interest you’ll pay (see CUMIPMT below).\n2. NPER — How Long Until You’re Debt-Free? What it does: Calculates how many months it will take to pay off a debt at a fixed monthly payment.\nFormula:\n=NPER(rate, pmt, pv) rate = monthly interest rate pmt = monthly payment (as a negative number) pv = current balance Example: Same $8,000 at 22% APR, but you can only pay $250/month.\n=NPER(22%/12, -250, 8000) Result: 43.5 months — over three and a half years.\nThis is a gut-punch formula in the best way. Most people guess wrong about their payoff timeline. NPER tells you the truth, which makes it the most motivating formula on this list.\nPro tip: Build a mini table. Column A: monthly payment amounts ($150, $200, $250, $300). Column B: =NPER(rate,-A2,balance). Watch how dramatically more months you’re paying when you drop even $50/month from your payment.\n3. CUMIPMT — See Exactly How Much Interest You’re Paying What it does: Calculates the total interest paid between any two payment periods.\nFormula:\n=CUMIPMT(rate, nper, pv, start_period, end_period, type) rate = monthly interest rate nper = total number of payments pv = loan amount start_period = first period to calculate (usually 1) end_period = last period (use same as nper to get the full total) type = 0 (payment at end of period) Example: You have a $15,000 car loan at 8% APR over 60 months. How much total interest will you pay?\n=CUMIPMT(8%/12, 60, 15000, 1, 60, 0) Result: -$3,306.14 (Excel returns it as negative — just read the absolute value)\nYou’re paying $3,300 in interest on top of the $15,000. That’s the real cost of the car.\nChange end_period to 12 to see how much interest you’ll pay in just the first year. It’s usually a much larger chunk than you’d expect — interest is front-loaded on most loans.\n4. IF — Build a Smart Payoff Priority List What it does: Creates conditional logic — “if this, then that.” For debt payoff, it’s perfect for flagging which debt to attack first.\nFormula:\n=IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false) Practical example: You have multiple debts in a table. Column A is the balance, Column B is the interest rate. You want Column C to flag which one to pay off first using the avalanche method (highest interest rate first).\n=IF(B2=MAX($B$2:$B$10), \"ATTACK FIRST\", \"Minimum only\") This marks the row with the highest interest rate as the one to focus on. Every other debt gets minimum payments until that one is gone.\nSnowball variation: Replace MAX($B$2:$B$10) with MIN($A$2:$A$10) to flag the smallest balance instead — the debt snowball method.\nWhether you’re a numbers person (avalanche) or a motivation person (snowball), the IF formula makes the choice automatic in your tracker.\n5. IPMT / PPMT — Break Down Every Single Payment What it does: IPMT calculates the interest portion of a specific payment. PPMT calculates the principal portion. Together, they show you how much of each payment is actually reducing your debt versus just paying the bank.\nFormulas:\n=IPMT(rate, per, nper, pv) =PPMT(rate, per, nper, pv) per = which payment number you want to analyze Example: You have a $5,000 personal loan at 12% APR over 36 months. How much of payment #1 is interest?\n=IPMT(12%/12, 1, 36, -5000) → $50 (interest) =PPMT(12%/12, 1, 36, -5000) → $116.07 (principal) Now check payment #36:\n=IPMT(12%/12, 36, 36, -5000) → $1.65 (interest) =PPMT(12%/12, 36, 36, -5000) → $164.42 (principal) By the final payment, almost every dollar is reducing your balance. Build an amortization table (payments 1 through 36 in column A, IPMT in column B, PPMT in column C) and you’ll see exactly how the balance shrinks over time — a powerful visual for staying motivated.\nPutting It All Together Here’s a simple debt tracker setup that uses all five formulas:\nDebt Balance APR Min Payment Payoff Months Total Interest Credit Card $6,200 24% $186 =NPER(…) =CUMIPMT(…) Car Loan $11,400 7% $225 =NPER(…) =CUMIPMT(…) Student Loan $18,000 5.5% $195 =NPER(…) =CUMIPMT(…) Add an IF column to flag the avalanche target, and you have a complete debt command center in one sheet.\nThe Bottom Line These five formulas — PMT, NPER, CUMIPMT, IF, and IPMT/PPMT — give you total visibility into your debt situation. No apps to subscribe to, no monthly fees. Just a spreadsheet and the truth.\nThe hardest part of getting out of debt isn’t the math. It’s facing the numbers. Once you do, these formulas turn raw balances into a clear, actionable plan with an actual finish line.\nWant a pre-built version? Check out our Debt Payoff Tracker template — it comes with these formulas already wired up, so you just enter your numbers and start tracking.\nNeed a ready-made template?
