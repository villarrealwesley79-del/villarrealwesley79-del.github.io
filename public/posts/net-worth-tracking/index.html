It's the only number that tells you if you're actually getting richer or just moving money around.","keywords":["net-worth","financial-tracking","wealth-building","personal-finance"],"articleBody":"Most people never calculate their net worth. They track income, maybe they track spending, but they don’t look at the actual picture: what they own minus what they owe.\nThat was me for years. I knew my salary. I could tell you my monthly budget. But I had no idea if I was actually building wealth or just treading water.\nThen I sat down with a spreadsheet and the number made me uncomfortable.\nI had a $47k car loan at 18% APR. A mortgage. Credit cards I’d convinced myself were “normal.” My net worth was negative. I was upside down.\nThat number did something a budget never did: it made me mad enough to actually change.\nWhy Net Worth Matters More Than Income Your income tells you what you make. Your net worth tells you if you’re keeping any of it.\nYou can make $100k a year and have a negative net worth if you spend $110k. Conversely, you can make $50k and have positive net worth if you’re disciplined.\nOnly net worth shows the real picture. It’s the single metric that actually matters for long-term wealth.\nWhen you track it monthly, you see the compound effect. An extra $500/month to debt payoff doesn’t feel massive in week one. But when you see your net worth jump $500 that month, then $600 the next month (because you paid off the highest interest rate), suddenly you have proof that the work is working.\nWhat to Track: Assets Start with what you own that has monetary value:\nBank accounts:\nChecking (your actual current balance) Savings accounts Money market accounts Anything that’s cash Check your actual balances. Not what you think you have. What’s actually there.\nInvestments:\nRetirement accounts (401k, IRA — these have actual current values) Brokerage accounts (stocks, ETFs, bonds) Cryptocurrencies (yes, if you own them) Check quarterly. The market moves, so don’t stress if it jumps or dips month to month.\nReal Estate:\nYour home (current market value, not purchase price) Rental properties Land Use recent comparable sales (Zillow, Redfin, local comps) not your purchase price. A house you bought for $200k in 2015 might be worth $350k now.\nVehicles:\nCars, trucks, motorcycles at current market value Use Kelley Blue Book, NADA Guides, or Edmunds with actual mileage and condition Other stuff:\nIf you’re tracking it, it goes here Don’t track:\nClothing, furniture, personal items. They have almost no resale value and they’ll drive you crazy trying to estimate. What to Track: Liabilities These are the debts:\nMortgage: Current balance (from mortgage statement), not the original loan amount\nCar loans: Current balance (from loan statement)\nStudent loans: Total of all balances\nCredit card debt: Total balance across all cards\nPersonal loans: Current balance\nMedical debt, legal debt, any debt: Current balance\nLines of credit or home equity loans: Current balance\nPull your actual balances. Don’t guess. Log into each account and write down the actual number.\nBuilding the Spreadsheet Create columns:\nAsset/Liability name (Checking Account, Car Loan, etc.) Current value or balance Date updated Create two sections: Assets and Liabilities.\nAt the top of Assets, put =SUM() of all your asset values. At the top of Liabilities, put =SUM() of all your liabilities.\nThen the magic formula: =Total Assets - Total Liabilities = Net Worth\nThat’s it. That’s the number that matters.\nMonth-to-Month Comparison Once you have one month, the next month is easy:\nUpdate each account balance Recalculate Add a column that shows the change from last month.\n=This month's net worth - Last month's net worth\nPositive? You’re building. Negative? Something went backwards.\nWatch for patterns. My net worth usually dips in January (car insurance, property taxes). It climbs in spring when I’m earning more. It jumps in the fall when rental income comes in.\nSeeing these patterns helps you understand when to push hard and when to protect what you’ve built.\nThe Monthly Review: 10-15 Minutes On the same day each month (I do the 1st), pull your actual numbers and update the spreadsheet.\nDon’t estimate. Don’t use last month’s number. Log in, get current balances, put them in.\nThis takes 10-15 minutes. It’s faster than watching one TV episode.\nThen spend 5 minutes looking at the numbers:\nWhat moved? Why? Am I on track? Did something jump that I didn’t expect? That’s the analysis. Most of it will be expected. Sometimes something surprises you. Good — now you know.\nWhat Your Net Worth Tells You Over time, tracking this tells you real things:\nAm I getting richer? Month-over-month growth means you’re building. Flat means you’re treading water. Declining means you’re losing ground.\nHow fast? If you’re increasing by $1,000/month, you can project ahead. At that rate, you’ll hit $100k net worth in 10 months. Knowing the speed changes how you think about timelines.\nWhere’s the growth coming from? Is your net worth climbing because home value is going up? Because you’re paying down debt? Because you’re saving? This tells you what’s actually working.\nAm I on track to my goals? If you want to retire in 10 years and you need $750k net worth, and you’re currently at $150k growing by $5k/month, you’re tracking fine. If you’re only growing by $1k/month, you need a different strategy.\nThe Psychological Shift Here’s what happens when you track this: you stop thinking about paychecks and start thinking about wealth.\nYou realize that a $5k raise doesn’t matter if you spend $6k more. But you also realize that cutting $300/month in waste actually works — that’s $3,600/year off the debt, which is real progress.\nThe number becomes your scoreboard. Your budget is instructions. Your net worth is the score.\nDon’t Compare Your Numbers to Anyone Else Your net worth is yours. Your friend making $120k but carrying $80k in debt has a lower net worth than someone making $60k with no debt.\nThe comparison game ruins everything. Track yours. Improve yours. That’s the whole game.\nStart This Month You don’t need the perfect spreadsheet. Open Google Sheets right now. Make a list of your accounts. Write down the current balances. Calculate net worth.\nThat number is your baseline. Next month, do it again.\nThat’s all it takes.\nWesley Villarreal holds an MBA in Accounting and has spent years in financial analysis.
