I’ve been the “spreadsheet guy” in my group chat since 2014. Friends send me screenshots of their bank feeds and ask, “Wes, which app should I actually pay for in 2026?” I finally got tired of copy-pasting the same voice-note, so here’s the long-form answer—no fluff, affiliate links included, and a DIY escape hatch if you hate recurring fees."><meta name=author content="FinanceCraftedSheets"><link rel=canonical href=https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/posts/best-budgeting-apps-2026-review/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/posts/best-budgeting-apps-2026-review/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-3820501485756986" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-3CJWBTD1SG"></script><script>var doNotTrack=!1,dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes";if(!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-3CJWBTD1SG")}</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/posts/best-budgeting-apps-2026-review/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="FinanceCraftedSheets"><meta property="og:title" content="FinanceCraftedSheets"><meta property="og:description" content=" title: “Best Budgeting Apps in 2026: YNAB vs Mint vs Tiller vs EveryDollar (Honest Review)” date: 2026-06-25T09:00:00-05:00 draft: false slug: “best-budgeting-apps-2026-review” categories: [“Money Tools”] tags: [“budgeting apps”,“YNAB”,“Mint”,“Tiller”,“EveryDollar”,“personal finance 2026”,“best budgeting apps 2026”] description: “Brutally honest 2026 review of YNAB, Mint, Tiller, and EveryDollar.

Otherwise, let’s dig in.\nYNAB (You Need A Budget) – The Cult Classic What It Actually Does YNAB is built on four rules that force you to give every dollar a job before you spend it. In 2026, version 7.6 added native multi-currency support and a long-awaited joint-account “Household” tier that finally lets spouses share categories without merging logins.\nPricing in 2026 Monthly: $14.99 Annual: $109 (effectively 3 months free) Student: Still free for 12 months with .edu email Real Pros Zero-based budgeting on autopilot: Once you trust the method, overspending is almost impossible. Age of Money \u003e 30 days: Gamified metric that keeps you one month ahead—psychologically huge. Direct import + manual fallback: If Plaid hiccups (and it still does), you can drag-and-drop CSVs without breaking the budget. Shared Household tier: My wife and I each have our “fun money” categories that the other can’t mess with. Honest Cons Learning cliff: The first 30 days feel like learning a new language. Expect YouTube rabbit holes. Price creep: $109/year isn’t Netflix money, but it is $1,308 over a decade. No bill pay: You still need your bank’s app to push payments. Who YNAB Is Actually Best For Couples who argue about money and need guardrails. People with variable income (freelancers, realtors, creators). Anyone who wants behavior change, not just tracking. My Take YNAB is the Peloton of budgeting apps—expensive, evangelical, but it works if you commit. I used it for 6 straight years and still recommend it to friends who hate spreadsheets.\nAffiliate link: Try YNAB free for 34 days (full disclosure: I get a month free if you subscribe).\nMint – The Free Giant (RIP, But Still Kicking) What It Actually Does Mint is the OG aggregator. You link accounts, it auto-categorizes, and spits out pretty pie charts. In 2026, Intuit finally killed the classic Mint app and migrated users to “Credit Karma Money” (yes, the name is confusing). The core Mint experience now lives inside Credit Karma with ads and credit-score upsells.\nPricing Free, but you’re the product. Expect credit-card and loan offers peppered throughout the feed. Real Pros Zero dollars: Hard to beat free. Automatic everything: Link accounts once, and you’re done. Credit-score monitoring: Weekly TransUnion updates baked in. Honest Cons Ad fatigue: Every third screen is a “pre-qualified” loan offer. Category chaos: It still thinks Chick-fil-A is “Fast Food” and Target is “Shopping – General.” Fixing 60 transactions a month gets old. No manual transactions: If your bank isn’t supported (lookin’ at you, local credit union), you’re out of luck. Sunset anxiety: Intuit has already sunset once; they’ll do it again. Who Mint Is Actually Best For People who want a one-time snapshot of net worth. Lazy budgeters who refuse to pay for software. Users who don’t mind ads and just need “good enough.” My Take I keep Mint/Credit Karma around for the credit-score alerts and nothing else. If you need granular control, look elsewhere.\nTiller – The Spreadsheet Wizard What It Actually Does Tiller feeds daily bank transactions into Google Sheets or Excel and auto-categorizes with user-defined rules. In 2026, they dropped a killer add-on called “Tiller Intelligence” that builds pivot tables and charts with natural-language prompts (“Show me my grocery spend last 90 days vs 2025”).\nPricing Monthly: $9.92 (billed annually at $119) 30-day free trial: No credit card required Real Pros Full spreadsheet freedom: Want to mash up crypto prices and grocery spend? Easy. Custom categories without limits: I have 73. YNAB caps at 200; Mint forces its own. Community templates: The Tiller community shares everything from FIRE calculators to Christmas sinking-fund sheets. No vendor lock-in: Cancel anytime; your data lives in your Google Drive. Honest Cons Spreadsheet comfort required: If =SUMIFS scares you, Tiller will feel like homework. No mobile native app: You’ll use Sheets on your phone, which is… fine. Bank lag: Yodlee sometimes takes 8–12 hours longer than Plaid. Who Tiller Is Actually Best For Spreadsheet nerds who want automation without losing control. Side-hustlers tracking multiple income streams. Anyone who wants to build a custom dashboard (I made one with real-time dividend yields). My Take Tiller is my daily driver now. I pair it with my own Excel templates (see below) for clients who refuse subscriptions.\nAffiliate link: Start Tiller free for 30 days.\nEveryDollar – The Ramsey Way What It Actually Does Built by Ramsey Solutions, EveryDollar is zero-based budgeting stripped to the essentials. The free version is manual entry only; the paid tier adds bank sync and group coaching calls.\nPricing Free: Manual only Ramsey+ (includes EveryDollar Premium): $17.99/month or $139.92/year Real Pros Dead simple interface: Add income, drag sliders to categories, done. Ramsey method baked in: Baby Steps tracker is front and center. Premium coaching: Weekly livestreams with Ramsey coaches included. Honest Cons Manual entry pain (free tier): I lasted 6 days before rage-quitting. Pricey for what you get: $18/mo is more than YNAB and way more than Tiller. Limited customization: Can’t split transactions across categories in free tier. Who EveryDollar Is Actually Best For Dave Ramsey superfans who want official endorsement. Church groups doing FPU classes together. People who prefer phone coaching over forum help. My Take EveryDollar is the iPhone of budgeting apps—pretty, locked down, and expensive. If you’re already drinking the Ramsey Kool-Aid, go for it. Otherwise, pass.\nThe DIY Alternative – My Etsy Excel Templates Look, I get it. Subscriptions add up. After fielding 200+ DMs asking for “just send me your sheet,” I packaged my three most popular Excel templates and listed them on Etsy:\nStarter Budget: One-page monthly zero-based budget. Sinking Funds Tracker: Automates Christmas, car maintenance, and vacation envelopes. Net-Worth Dashboard: Pulls live stock prices and crypto via built-in APIs. Price: $9–$12 one-time. No macros, no yearly fees, and you can hack them however you want.\nLink: Grab the templates here (instant download, lifetime updates).\nHead-to-Head Deep Dive Ease of Setup (1 = painful, 5 = brain-dead) Mint: 5 – Link accounts, done. EveryDollar: 4 – Manual but intuitive. YNAB: 3 – Need to learn the method first. Tiller: 2 – Must authorize Google Sheets and tweak rules. Bank Connectivity Reliability YNAB: Plaid + MX redundancy, 99% uptime in 2026. Mint/Credit Karma: Plaid only, occasional 2FA loops. Tiller: Yodlee, slower but stable. EveryDollar: Manual free tier, MX in paid tier (solid). Reporting Depth Tiller: Infinite (you code it). YNAB: Built-in reports + Toolkit extension. Mint: Basic pie charts, no custom date ranges. EveryDollar: Baby Steps only. Customer Support YNAB: 24/7 chat, killer YouTube library. Tiller: Email, 1-day turnaround, private Facebook group. EveryDollar: Phone + live chat (Ramsey+ only). Mint: None (community forums only). Real-Life Scenarios The Freelancer with Variable Income Use YNAB. Rule 4 (“Age your money”) smooths feast-or-famine cycles. I lived on last month’s invoices while building my agency.\nThe Couple Who Can’t Agree on “Fun Money” Use YNAB Household tier. Separate logins, shared categories, no more Venmo wars.\nThe Spreadsheet Addict Use Tiller + my Etsy templates. Build whatever your nerd heart desires.\nThe Dave Ramsey Church Group Use EveryDollar Premium. Built-in FPU integration keeps everyone on the same page.\nFAQ – 2026 Edition Q: Is Mint dead? A: Sort of. The classic app is sunset; the experience lives inside Credit Karma. Same data, more ads.\nQ: Can I run YNAB and Tiller together? A: Yes. I export YNAB CSVs into Tiller for custom charts. Overkill? Maybe. Satisfying? Absolutely.\nQ: What about Monarch, Copilot, Rocket Money? A: Honorable mentions, but none cracked my top 4 for 2026. Monarch is $14.99 and still missing split transactions; Copilot is iOS-only; Rocket Money is 90% subscription-cancel service.\nBottom Line If you want behavior change and don’t mind paying, get YNAB.\nIf you want spreadsheet freedom, get Tiller.\nIf you want free and lazy, use Mint inside Credit Karma.\nIf you want Ramsey branding, get EveryDollar.\nIf you hate subscriptions, grab my Etsy Excel templates and call it a day.\nYour money, your call.\n","wordCount":"1534","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"FinanceCraftedSheets"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/posts/best-budgeting-apps-2026-review/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"FinanceCraftedSheets","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://villarrealwesley79-del.github.io/ accesskey=h title="FinanceCraftedSheets (Alt + H)">FinanceCraftedSheets</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

description: &ldquo;Brutally honest 2026 review of YNAB, Mint, Tiller, and EveryDollar. Real pros, cons, pricing, and who each app is actually best for. Plus a DIY Excel alternative if you hate subscriptions.&rdquo;</h2><p>I’ve been the “spreadsheet guy” in my group chat since 2014. Friends send me screenshots of their bank feeds and ask, “Wes, which app should I actually pay for in 2026?” I finally got tired of copy-pasting the same voice-note, so here’s the long-form answer—no fluff, affiliate links included, and a DIY escape hatch if you hate recurring fees.</p><h2 id=quick-verdict-table>Quick Verdict Table<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#quick-verdict-table>#</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>App</th><th>Best For</th><th>Real Monthly Cost (2026)</th><th>Bank Sync</th><th>Manual Option</th><th>Learning Curve</th><th>DIY-Friendliness</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YNAB</td><td>Rule-based budget nerds</td><td>$14.99 ($109/yr)</td><td>✅ Plaid + MX</td><td>✅</td><td>Medium-Steep</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Mint</td><td>Set-it-and-forget-it users</td><td>Free (ad-supported)</td><td>✅ Plaid + Finicity</td><td>❌</td><td>Low</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Tiller</td><td>Spreadsheet addicts with automation</td><td>$9.92 ($119/yr)</td><td>✅ Yodlee</td><td>✅</td><td>Medium</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>EveryDollar</td><td>Dave Ramsey die-hards</td><td>Free / $17.99 mo (Ramsey+)</td><td>❌ (manual free) / ✅ (paid)</td><td>✅</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you want the TL;DR, skip to the bottom for my “just give me the Excel” section. Otherwise, let’s dig in.</p><hr><h2 id=ynab-you-need-a-budget--the-cult-classic>YNAB (You Need A Budget) – The Cult Classic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ynab-you-need-a-budget--the-cult-classic>#</a></h2><h3 id=what-it-actually-does>What It Actually Does<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-it-actually-does>#</a></h3><p>YNAB is built on four rules that force you to give every dollar a job <em>before</em> you spend it. In 2026, version 7.6 added native multi-currency support and a long-awaited joint-account “Household” tier that finally lets spouses share categories without merging logins.</p><h3 id=pricing-in-2026>Pricing in 2026<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pricing-in-2026>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Monthly</strong>: $14.99</li><li><strong>Annual</strong>: $109 (effectively 3 months free)</li><li><strong>Student</strong>: Still free for 12 months with .edu email</li></ul><h3 id=real-pros>Real Pros<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#real-pros>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Zero-based budgeting on autopilot</strong>: Once you trust the method, overspending is almost impossible.</li><li><strong>Age of Money > 30 days</strong>: Gamified metric that keeps you one month ahead—psychologically huge.</li><li><strong>Direct import + manual fallback</strong>: If Plaid hiccups (and it still does), you can drag-and-drop CSVs without breaking the budget.</li><li><strong>Shared Household tier</strong>: My wife and I each have our “fun money” categories that the other can’t mess with.</li></ul><h3 id=honest-cons>Honest Cons<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#honest-cons>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Learning cliff</strong>: The first 30 days feel like learning a new language. Expect YouTube rabbit holes.</li><li><strong>Price creep</strong>: $109/year isn’t Netflix money, but it <em>is</em> $1,308 over a decade.</li><li><strong>No bill pay</strong>: You still need your bank’s app to push payments.</li></ul><h3 id=who-ynab-is-actually-best-for>Who YNAB Is Actually Best For<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#who-ynab-is-actually-best-for>#</a></h3><ul><li>Couples who argue about money and need guardrails.</li><li>People with variable income (freelancers, realtors, creators).</li><li>Anyone who wants <em>behavior change</em>, not just tracking.</li></ul><h3 id=my-take>My Take<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-take>#</a></h3><p>YNAB is the Peloton of budgeting apps—expensive, evangelical, but it works if you commit. I used it for 6 straight years and still recommend it to friends who hate spreadsheets.</p><p><strong>Affiliate link</strong>: <a href=https://ynab.com/wes34>Try YNAB free for 34 days</a> (full disclosure: I get a month free if you subscribe).</p><hr><h2 id=mint--the-free-giant-rip-but-still-kicking>Mint – The Free Giant (RIP, But Still Kicking)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mint--the-free-giant-rip-but-still-kicking>#</a></h2><h3 id=what-it-actually-does-1>What It Actually Does<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-it-actually-does-1>#</a></h3><p>Mint is the OG aggregator. You link accounts, it auto-categorizes, and spits out pretty pie charts. In 2026, Intuit <em>finally</em> killed the classic Mint app and migrated users to “Credit Karma Money” (yes, the name is confusing). The core Mint experience now lives inside Credit Karma with ads and credit-score upsells.</p><h3 id=pricing>Pricing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pricing>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Free</strong>, but you’re the product. Expect credit-card and loan offers peppered throughout the feed.</li></ul><h3 id=real-pros-1>Real Pros<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#real-pros-1>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Zero dollars</strong>: Hard to beat free.</li><li><strong>Automatic everything</strong>: Link accounts once, and you’re done.</li><li><strong>Credit-score monitoring</strong>: Weekly TransUnion updates baked in.</li></ul><h3 id=honest-cons-1>Honest Cons<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#honest-cons-1>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Ad fatigue</strong>: Every third screen is a “pre-qualified” loan offer.</li><li><strong>Category chaos</strong>: It still thinks Chick-fil-A is “Fast Food” and Target is “Shopping – General.” Fixing 60 transactions a month gets old.</li><li><strong>No manual transactions</strong>: If your bank isn’t supported (lookin’ at you, local credit union), you’re out of luck.</li><li><strong>Sunset anxiety</strong>: Intuit has already sunset once; they’ll do it again.</li></ul><h3 id=who-mint-is-actually-best-for>Who Mint Is Actually Best For<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#who-mint-is-actually-best-for>#</a></h3><ul><li>People who want a one-time snapshot of net worth.</li><li>Lazy budgeters who refuse to pay for software.</li><li>Users who don’t mind ads and just need “good enough.”</li></ul><h3 id=my-take-1>My Take<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-take-1>#</a></h3><p>I keep Mint/Credit Karma around for the credit-score alerts and nothing else. If you need granular control, look elsewhere.</p><hr><h2 id=tiller--the-spreadsheet-wizard>Tiller – The Spreadsheet Wizard<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tiller--the-spreadsheet-wizard>#</a></h2><h3 id=what-it-actually-does-2>What It Actually Does<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-it-actually-does-2>#</a></h3><p>Tiller feeds daily bank transactions into Google Sheets or Excel and auto-categorizes with user-defined rules. In 2026, they dropped a killer add-on called “Tiller Intelligence” that builds pivot tables and charts with natural-language prompts (“Show me my grocery spend last 90 days vs 2025”).</p><h3 id=pricing-1>Pricing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pricing-1>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Monthly</strong>: $9.92 (billed annually at $119)</li><li><strong>30-day free trial</strong>: No credit card required</li></ul><h3 id=real-pros-2>Real Pros<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#real-pros-2>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Full spreadsheet freedom</strong>: Want to mash up crypto prices and grocery spend?

If you’re already drinking the Ramsey Kool-Aid, go for it. Otherwise, pass.</p><hr><h2 id=the-diy-alternative--my-etsy-excel-templates>The DIY Alternative – My Etsy Excel Templates<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-diy-alternative--my-etsy-excel-templates>#</a></h2><p>Look, I get it.

A: Sort of. The classic app is sunset; the <em>experience</em> lives inside Credit Karma. Same data, more ads.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I run YNAB and Tiller together?</strong>
A: Yes. I export YNAB CSVs into Tiller for custom charts. Overkill? Maybe. Satisfying? Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Q: What about Monarch, Copilot, Rocket Money?</strong>
A: Honorable mentions, but none cracked my top 4 for 2026. Monarch is $14.99 and still missing split transactions; Copilot is iOS-only; Rocket Money is 90% subscription-cancel service.</p><hr><h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom Line<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bottom-line>#</a></h2><p>If you want <strong>behavior change</strong> and don’t mind paying, get <strong>YNAB</strong>.<br>If you want <strong>spreadsheet freedom</strong>, get <strong>Tiller</strong>.<br>If you want <strong>free and lazy</strong>, use <strong>Mint inside Credit Karma</strong>.<br>If you want <strong>Ramsey branding</strong>, get <strong>EveryDollar</strong>.</p><p>If you hate subscriptions, grab my <strong>Etsy Excel templates</strong> and call it a day.</p><p>Your money, your call.</p></div><div class=author-bio style="margin-top:2rem;padding:1.2rem;border:1px solid var(--border);border-radius:8px;background:var(--code-bg)"><p style=margin:0;font-size:.95rem;line-height:1.6><strong>About FinanceCraftedSheets</strong> · We create practical budget templates, debt trackers, and financial tools designed to simplify money management.
