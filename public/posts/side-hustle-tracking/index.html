Etsy charges 3.5% transaction fee. Payment processing takes another 3%. Shipping costs eat $8. Your supplies were $12.\nYou think you made $50. You actually made $20. Maybe less if you count your time.\nMost side hustlers don’t do this math. They look at the top-line number and think they’re winning.\nThen tax time hits and they owe money they didn’t set aside, or they realize they’ve been running at a loss for six months.\nTracking fixes this. It takes 15 minutes a week and saves you from complete blindness.\nWhy You’re Probably Losing Money Platform fees are a hidden tax.\nEtsy: 3.5% transaction fee + 4% payment processing (depending on your payment method) Fiverr: 20% commission on every order Amazon FBA: 45% of the sale goes to Amazon for some categories YouTube: 45% cut before you see anything Affiliates: varies, but they take a cut too You think you made $10,000 on Etsy? You probably made $9,000 after platform cuts. That’s income gone before you even count supplies.\nShipping and packaging aren’t free.\nIf you’re selling physical products, packaging costs money Shipping is the most deductible expense and everyone forgets to track it On a $20 Etsy product, shipping might be $5 actual cost Self-employment tax sneaks up.\nThe IRS wants 15.3% of your net profit for self-employment tax Most side hustlers don’t set aside 25-30% of what they earn for taxes January hits and they owe $3,000 they didn’t budget for Time is worth something.\nIf you spend 10 hours making $100, that’s $10/hour That’s less than minimum wage in most states You need to know if your side hustle is actually worth your time Burnout happens when profit is low.\nYou work a side hustle to make money, not to have a second job that pays nothing If you’re not tracking, you don’t realize you’re not actually profiting You burn out on something you thought was profitable but wasn’t The Critical Metrics You need five numbers to understand if your side hustle is working:\nGross Revenue: Total money in, before anything comes out.\nPlatform Fees: All the platform’s cuts (Etsy, Fiverr, payment processing).\nDirect Costs: Supplies, shipping, packaging, anything directly tied to each sale.\nTime Investment: Hours spent weekly (for calculating hourly rate).\nNet Profit: Gross revenue minus fees and costs.\nThat’s it. These five numbers tell you if the business is working.\nExample:\nGross revenue this month: $1,200 Platform fees (3.5% + 4%): -$90 Direct costs (supplies + shipping): -$300 Hours worked: 20 Net profit: $810 That’s $810 profit on 20 hours = $40.50/hour.\nIs that good? Depends on your market and what else you could do. But at least you know the truth.\nBuilding Your Side Hustle Tracker This is simple. Google Sheets is perfect. Create columns:\nTransaction-level tracking:\nDate Platform (Etsy, Fiverr, direct client, etc.) Revenue Platform fee (calculate or note actual) Shipping cost Supply cost Direct cost total Net on this transaction At the bottom of each month:\nTotal gross revenue Total platform fees Total direct costs Total net profit Hours worked Net per hour That’s your monthly scorecard.\nTracking by Platform Different platforms require different approaches because they report data differently:\nEtsy:\nEtsy gives you a sales report showing fees. Copy that monthly. You track supply costs yourself (you know what you spent) You track shipping costs (keep receipts) Calculate net monthly Fiverr:\nFiverr shows revenue after their 20% cut (so $100 order shows $80) You need to track expenses separately Time tracking is critical because Fiverr gigs often pay terribly per hour Direct client work (freelancing):\nYou invoice and track hours Platform fees are near zero Software subscriptions count as business costs This is usually highest margin work YouTube/TikTok/content:\nRevenue is shared and delayed (sometimes 30+ days) Costs are minimal if you’re using your phone Hourly rate depends entirely on how much content you create Most people overestimate hours because they’re counting phone scroll time as work Dropshipping/Amazon:\nEverything is tracked for you but the percentages are brutal Amazon FBA takes 45% from books, higher for other categories Shipping is included in their cut Inventory sitting costs you money Know your platform’s economics before you start.\nThe Expense Trap: What Actually Counts Count these as expenses:\nSupplies that directly make your product (fabric, wood, plastic, etc.) Shipping and packaging materials Shipping cost you pay to get items to customers Software subscriptions for your business (Photoshop, Canva, etc.) Business equipment (if it’s brand new for the hustle) Marketing spend if you’re advertising Don’t count these:\nTime (you calculate hourly rate separately) Your existing phone/computer (unless you’re buying new) General internet (it’s not dedicated to the hustle) Personal expenses you’re trying to deduct as business Things you already owned This matters for taxes. The IRS will deny obviously personal expenses. Keep it clean.\nMonthly Review: Finding the Leaks Spend 30 minutes monthly looking at your numbers:\nWhat sold the most? Identify your best products/services. Focus there.\nWhat had the best margin? Something might sell a lot but barely profit. Something else might sell less but profit way more. Which should you push?\nWhere are the costs? Is shipping killing you? Supply costs too high? Platform fees unreasonable? Can you fix it?\nAre you profitable per hour? If you’re making $10/hour, something needs to change. Either increase price, lower costs, or work faster.\nShould you pivot or scale? If it’s working (decent margin, decent hourly rate), scale it. If it’s barely breaking even, either fix it or kill it. Don’t waste time on low-margin work hoping it improves.\nReal Example: My Experience With Etsy Templates I sell Excel templates on Etsy. For a $15 template:\nEtsy takes 7.5% (transaction + payment processing) Actual cost to me: $0.50 (Etsy fee) My time: 30-45 minutes to build Revenue: $15 Profit: $14.50 Hourly rate: $19-29/hour Is that good? For passive income where I’ve already built the template, yes. The profit per unit is high and the time investment is front-loaded.\nCompare that to services where I bill by hour but have high costs. A $100 service might cost $30 in platform fees and expenses, leaving $70 profit. But if it takes 5 hours, that’s $14/hour.\nThe numbers tell a story. Use them.\nSetting Your Minimum Threshold Decide right now: what’s the minimum you’ll accept?\nMinimum hourly rate for active work (I wouldn’t do less than $20/hour) Minimum profit margin on products (probably 40%+) Minimum monthly revenue to justify continuing (maybe $500?) If the hustle doesn’t hit these, you kill it or fix it. Don’t let low-margin work persist out of stubbornness.\nTax Obligation Reality Whatever you make on your side hustle, set aside 25-30% for taxes. You’ll owe self-employment tax (15.3%) plus income tax on whatever your bracket is.\nIf you made $5,000 net profit, set aside $1,250-1,500 immediately. Put it in a separate account. Don’t spend it.\nQuarterly estimated taxes are technically required for side hustlers making over $400. Most people skip this and settle it in April. It’s easier to just set money aside monthly.\nStop the Bleeding You probably have a side hustle right now or you’re thinking about starting one.\nOpen a spreadsheet today. For the next month, log every transaction. Revenue in, costs out.\nOne month of real data will tell you more than three months of guessing.\nIf it’s profitable, you’ll know. If it’s not, you’ll fix it or quit it. But you’ll actually know.\nThat’s the whole point.\nWesley Villarreal holds an MBA in Accounting and has spent years in financial analysis.
