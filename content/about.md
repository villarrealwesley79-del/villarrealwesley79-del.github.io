## About FinanceCraftedSheets

### Our Story

FinanceCraftedSheets was founded on a simple belief: **managing money should be simple, clear, and empowering.** We believe that with the right tools and knowledge, anyone can take control of their finances — regardless of their background or current financial situation.

We spent years watching people struggle with confusing spreadsheets, overwhelming budgeting apps, and conflicting financial advice. So we decided to create something different: beautifully designed, easy-to-use budget templates and financial spreadsheets that actually make sense.

### What We Offer

We create practical financial tools and resources available on Etsy, including:

- **Budget Templates** — Monthly, weekly, and annual budgets for Google Sheets and Excel
- **Debt Payoff Trackers** — Snowball and avalanche method calculators
- **Savings Goal Planners** — Track your progress toward financial freedom
- **Expense Trackers** — Categorize and visualize your spending
- **Net Worth Dashboards** — Monitor your financial progress over time
- **Educational Content** — Articles, guides, and tips on personal finance

### Why Our Templates?

Every template is crafted with three principles in mind:

1. **Clean Design** — Beautiful, distraction-free layouts that make tracking your money enjoyable
2. **Clear Instructions** — Step-by-step guidance so you know exactly how to use each tool
3. **Automatic Calculations** — No complicated formulas to figure out — just plug in your numbers and go

### Our Mission

FinanceCraftedSheets exists to empower people with practical financial tools and education. We believe that financial literacy and smart money management are within reach for everyone, and our goal is to make the journey easier, clearer, and more rewarding.
