### 2. Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on the FinanceCraftedSheets Site for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

- Modify or copy the materials
- Use the materials for any commercial purpose or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial)
- Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on the Site
- Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials

The materials on the FinanceCraftedSheets Site are provided for informational purposes only. FinanceCraftedSheets makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

### 4. Limitations

In no event shall FinanceCraftedSheets or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on the FinanceCraftedSheets Site, even if FinanceCraftedSheets or an authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

FinanceCraftedSheets does not warrant that any of the materials on the Site are accurate, complete, or current. FinanceCraftedSheets may make changes to the materials contained on its Site at any time without notice.

### 6. Materials and Content

### 9. Limitation of Liability

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:**

FinanceCraftedSheets shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, even if FinanceCraftedSheets has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
