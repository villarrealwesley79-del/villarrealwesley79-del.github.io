**Goal: $3,450 in six months while still attacking debt. No excuses.**

## 1. Target Size

Median household essential expenses in 2026:

| Household Size | Rent/Mortgage | Utilities | Food | Transport | Insurance | Phone | Total |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1 adult        | $1,150        | $105      | $220 | $120      | $65       | $45   | $1,705 |
| 2 adults       | $1,400        | $135      | $380 | $220      | $110      | $80   | $2,325 |
| 2+1 child      | $1,700        | $180      | $520 | $250      | $150      | $90   | $2,890 |

Sources: HUD FY 2026 Fair Market Rents, USDA June 2026 Food Plans, BLS CPI-W transport index, insurer filings (State Farm, Geico, Kaiser).

Use your actual bills. Multiply by 3. That is your target.

Example: Single adult = $1,705 × 3 = **$5,115**.  
Six-month build = **$852.50 per month**.

## 2. Baseline Budget (Real Numbers)

Template based on 2026 IRS take-home calculator (single, $38k gross, 0 exemptions):

- **Net pay:** $2,648/month  
- **Minimum debt service:** $620 (weighted avg APR 18.6%)  
- **Fixed essentials:** $1,705 (from table)  
- **Discretionary:** $323  
- **Deficit before fund:** –$500

Close the gap.

## 3. Income Stack

Use three tiers. Track weekly hours in a spreadsheet.

| Tier | Gig | Median 2026 Pay | Realistic Hours/Week | Net After Tax |
|------|-----|------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Grocery delivery (Instacart, Shipt) | $22/hr | 4 | $352 |
| 2 | Remote micro-tasks (Appen, Clickworker) | $18/hr | 3 | $216 |
| 3 | Weekend pet sitting (Rover) | $35/night | 2 | $280 |

Total side income: **$848/month**.  
Assume 75 % availability (illness, app drought) = **$636 safe take**.

## 4. Debt Interaction

During the 6-month build, **interest compounds**.

Scenario: $8,200 balance at 18.6 % APR.

- Minimum payment = $123 (interest-only)  
- Extra $497/month keeps balance flat  
- Allocate $636 side income:  
  – $497 prevents growth  
  – $139 left for emergency fund

If you divert **all** side income to the fund, balance grows $123 × 6 = $738. Accept the trade-off or adjust.

Read [avalanche vs snowball](/posts/avalanche-vs-snowball/) for deeper math.

## 5. Expense Cuts

Pick two and execute within 48 hours.

- **Groceries:** Switch to USDA Thrifty Plan → save $80/month  
- **Transport:** Monthly transit pass vs. car (insurance + fuel) → save $150/month  
- **Housing:** Host roommate 3 nights/week via SpareRoom → save $200/month

Document in [zero-based budget](/posts/zero-based-budgeting/).

## 6. Automation

1. Open high-yield savings at 4.25 % (Ally, Marcus).  
2. Split direct deposit:  
   - $425 to emergency fund  
   - $211 to debt (keeps balance neutral)  
3. Sweep leftover checking balance every Friday via scheduled transfer.

## 7. Contingency Scenarios

| Income Shock | Impact | Adjustment |
|---------------|--------|------------|
| 50 % hours cut | –$1,324 | Pause debt extra payments, tap side gigs Tier 1+2 aggressively, cut discretionary to $0 |
| Gig app outage (2 weeks) | –$318 | Sell plasma ($90/week), shift to TaskRabbit odd jobs |
| Childcare emergency | +$400/month | Extend build to 8 months ($3,450 ÷ 8 = $431/month) |

## 8. Partial Success Models

If you hit **50 % of goal**, you still cover essentials for 1.5 months.  
If you hit **75 %**, you cover 2.25 months.  
Document actual vs. planned in a shared Google Sheet. Treat as data, not failure.

## 9. Week-by-Week Tracker

```text
Week 1: Open accounts, list gigs, cut grocery tier.
Week 2: First side hustle shift, log hours.
Week 3: Sell unused items (Facebook Marketplace), target $200.
Week 4: Review actual vs. plan, adjust gigs.
Week 5-24: Repeat, compound interest visible monthly.
```

- [ ] Know your exact 3-month number  
- [ ] Side hustle accounts active and tested  
- [ ] Direct deposit split configured
