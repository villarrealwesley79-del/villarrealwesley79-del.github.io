I’ve been the “spreadsheet guy” in my group chat since 2014. Friends send me screenshots of their bank feeds and ask, “Wes, which app should I actually pay for in 2026?” I finally got tired of copy-pasting the same voice-note, so here’s the long-form answer—no fluff, affiliate links included, and a DIY escape hatch if you hate recurring fees.

## Quick Verdict Table

| App | Best For | Real Monthly Cost (2026) | Bank Sync | Manual Option | Learning Curve | DIY-Friendliness |
|-----|----------|-------------------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| YNAB | Rule-based budget nerds | $14.99 ($109/yr) | ✅ Plaid + MX | ✅ | Medium-Steep | Low |
| Mint | Set-it-and-forget-it users | Free (ad-supported) | ✅ Plaid + Finicity | ❌ | Low | Medium |
| Tiller | Spreadsheet addicts with automation | $9.92 ($119/yr) | ✅ Yodlee | ✅ | Medium | High |
| EveryDollar | Dave Ramsey die-hards | Free / $17.99 mo (Ramsey+) | ❌ (manual free) / ✅ (paid) | ✅ | Low | Low |

If you want the TL;DR, skip to the bottom for my “just give me the Excel” section. Otherwise, let’s dig in.

## YNAB (You Need A Budget) – The Cult Classic

### What It Actually Does
YNAB is built on four rules that force you to give every dollar a job *before* you spend it. In 2026, version 7.6 added native multi-currency support and a long-awaited joint-account “Household” tier that finally lets spouses share categories without merging logins.

### Pricing in 2026
- **Monthly**: $14.99
- **Annual**: $109 (effectively 3 months free)
- **Student**: Still free for 12 months with .edu email

### Real Pros
- **Zero-based budgeting on autopilot**: Once you trust the method, overspending is almost impossible.
- **Age of Money > 30 days**: Gamified metric that keeps you one month ahead—psychologically huge.
- **Direct import + manual fallback**: If Plaid hiccups (and it still does), you can drag-and-drop CSVs without breaking the budget.
- **Shared Household tier**: My wife and I each have our “fun money” categories that the other can’t mess with.

### Honest Cons
- **Learning cliff**: The first 30 days feel like learning a new language. Expect YouTube rabbit holes.
- **Price creep**: $109/year isn’t Netflix money, but it *is* $1,308 over a decade.
- **No bill pay**: You still need your bank’s app to push payments.

### Who YNAB Is Actually Best For
- Couples who argue about money and need guardrails.
- People with variable income (freelancers, realtors, creators).
- Anyone who wants *behavior change*, not just tracking.

### My Take
YNAB is the Peloton of budgeting apps—expensive, evangelical, but it works if you commit. I used it for 6 straight years and still recommend it to friends who hate spreadsheets.

**Affiliate link**: [Try YNAB free for 34 days](https://ynab.com/wes34) (full disclosure: I get a month free if you subscribe).

## Mint – The Free Giant (RIP, But Still Kicking)

### What It Actually Does
Mint is the OG aggregator. You link accounts, it auto-categorizes, and spits out pretty pie charts. In 2026, Intuit *finally* killed the classic Mint app and migrated users to “Credit Karma Money” (yes, the name is confusing). The core Mint experience now lives inside Credit Karma with ads and credit-score upsells.

### Pricing
- **Free**, but you’re the product. Expect credit-card and loan offers peppered throughout the feed.

### Real Pros
- **Zero dollars**: Hard to beat free.
- **Automatic everything**: Link accounts once, and you’re done.
- **Credit-score monitoring**: Weekly TransUnion updates baked in.

### Honest Cons
- **Ad fatigue**: Every third screen is a “pre-qualified” loan offer.
- **Category chaos**: It still thinks Chick-fil-A is “Fast Food” and Target is “Shopping – General.” Fixing 60 transactions a month gets old.
- **No manual transactions**: If your bank isn’t supported (lookin’ at you, local credit union), you’re out of luck.
- **Sunset anxiety**: Intuit has already sunset once; they’ll do it again.

### Who Mint Is Actually Best For
- People who want a one-time snapshot of net worth.
- Lazy budgeters who refuse to pay for software.
- Users who don’t mind ads and just need “good enough.”

### My Take
I keep Mint/Credit Karma around for the credit-score alerts and nothing else. If you need granular control, look elsewhere.

## Tiller – The Spreadsheet Wizard

### What It Actually Does
Tiller feeds daily bank transactions into Google Sheets or Excel and auto-categorizes with user-defined rules. In 2026, they dropped a killer add-on called “Tiller Intelligence” that builds pivot tables and charts with natural-language prompts (“Show me my grocery spend last 90 days vs 2025”).

### Pricing
- **Monthly**: $9.92 (billed annually at $119)
- **30-day free trial**: No credit card required

### Real Pros
- **Full spreadsheet freedom**: Want to mash up crypto prices and grocery spend? Easy.
- **Custom categories without limits**: I have 73. YNAB caps at 200; Mint forces its own.
- **Community templates**: The Tiller community shares everything from FIRE calculators to Christmas sinking-fund sheets.
- **No vendor lock-in**: Cancel anytime; your data lives in your Google Drive.

### Honest Cons
- **Spreadsheet comfort required**: If `=SUMIFS` scares you, Tiller will feel like homework.
- **No mobile native app**: You’ll use Sheets on your phone, which is… fine.
- **Bank lag**: Yodlee sometimes takes 8–12 hours longer than Plaid.

### Who Tiller Is Actually Best For
- Spreadsheet nerds who want automation without losing control.
- Side-hustlers tracking multiple income streams.
- Anyone who wants to build a custom dashboard (I made one with real-time dividend yields).

### My Take
Tiller is my daily driver now. I pair it with my own Excel templates (see below) for clients who refuse subscriptions.

## EveryDollar – The Ramsey Way

### What It Actually Does
Built by Ramsey Solutions, EveryDollar is zero-based budgeting stripped to the essentials. The free version is manual entry only; the paid tier adds bank sync and group coaching calls.

### Pricing
- **Free**: Manual only
- **Ramsey+ (includes EveryDollar Premium)**: $17.99/month or $139.92/year

### Real Pros
- **Dead simple interface**: Add income, drag sliders to categories, done.
- **Ramsey method baked in**: Baby Steps tracker is front and center.
- **Premium coaching**: Weekly livestreams with Ramsey coaches included.

### Honest Cons
- **Manual entry pain** (free tier): I lasted 6 days before rage-quitting.
- **Pricey for what you get**: $18/mo is more than YNAB and *way* more than Tiller.
- **Limited customization**: Can’t split transactions across categories in free tier.

### Who EveryDollar Is Actually Best For
- Dave Ramsey superfans who want official endorsement.
- Church groups doing FPU classes together.
- People who prefer phone coaching over forum help.

### My Take
EveryDollar is the iPhone of budgeting apps—pretty, locked down, and expensive. If you’re already drinking the Ramsey Kool-Aid, go for it. Otherwise, pass.

- **Starter Budget**: One-page monthly zero-based budget.
- **Sinking Funds Tracker**: Automates Christmas, car maintenance, and vacation envelopes.
- **Net-Worth Dashboard**: Pulls live stock prices and crypto via built-in APIs.

**Price**: $9–$12 one-time. No macros, no yearly fees, and you can hack them however you want.

**Link**: [Grab the templates here](https://etsy.me/wesleybudget) (instant download, lifetime updates).

## Real-Life Scenarios

### The Freelancer with Variable Income
Use **YNAB**. Rule 4 (“Age your money”) smooths feast-or-famine cycles. I lived on last month’s invoices while building my agency.

### The Couple Who Can’t Agree on “Fun Money”
Use **YNAB Household tier**. Separate logins, shared categories, no more Venmo wars.

### The Spreadsheet Addict
Use **Tiller** + my Etsy templates. Build whatever your nerd heart desires.

### The Dave Ramsey Church Group
Use **EveryDollar Premium**. Built-in FPU integration keeps everyone on the same page.

## FAQ – 2026 Edition

**Q: Is Mint dead?**
A: Sort of. The classic app is sunset; the *experience* lives inside Credit Karma. Same data, more ads.

**Q: Can I run YNAB and Tiller together?**
A: Yes. I export YNAB CSVs into Tiller for custom charts. Overkill? Maybe. Satisfying? Absolutely.

**Q: What about Monarch, Copilot, Rocket Money?**
A: Honorable mentions, but none cracked my top 4 for 2026. Monarch is $14.99 and still missing split transactions; Copilot is iOS-only; Rocket Money is 90% subscription-cancel service.

---

## Bottom Line

If you want **behavior change** and don’t mind paying, get **YNAB**.  
If you want **spreadsheet freedom**, get **Tiller**.  
If you want **free and lazy**, use **Mint inside Credit Karma**.  
If you want **Ramsey branding**, get **EveryDollar**.

If you hate subscriptions, grab my **Etsy Excel templates** and call it a day.

Your money, your call.
