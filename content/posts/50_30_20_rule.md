## What Is the 50/30/20 Rule?

This simple framework divides after-tax income into:
- **50% Needs** (rent, utilities, groceries)
- **30% Wants** (entertainment, dining out)
- **20% Savings/Debt** (emergency fund, loan payments)

Popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, it's great for beginners but has limitations.

## When It Works

### Scenario 1: Stable Income, No Major Debt
For someone earning $5,000/month after taxes:
| Category | Amount | Reality Check |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Needs    | $2,500 | Realistic for mid-sized cities |
| Wants    | $1,500 | Covers moderate lifestyle |
| Savings  | $1,000 | Meets emergency fund guidelines |

### Scenario 2: Simple Budgeting Needs
If you:
- Don't track expenses yet
- Want quick financial organization
- Have predictable income

## When It Fails

### Problem 1: High Cost of Living
In cities like NYC/SF, 50% might not cover:
- Rent ($2,500+)
- Transportation ($200)
- Basic groceries ($600)

### Problem 2: Irregular Income
Freelancers with variable earnings often:
- Underfund savings during lean months
- Overspend during high-income periods

### Problem 3: Unique Financial Goals
The rule doesn't address:
- Aggressive debt repayment
- Early retirement planning
- Major purchases (house, car)

## Better Alternatives

### Option 1: Zero-Based Budgeting
Every dollar gets a job:
```text
Income: $4,500
↓
Rent: $1,800
Groceries: $600
Debt Payment: $1,000
Savings: $700
Entertainment: $400
↓
Balance: $0
```

### Option 2: 80/20 Rule for Debt
Prioritize debt payoff:
- 80% Essentials + Debt Payments
- 20% Flex Spending
