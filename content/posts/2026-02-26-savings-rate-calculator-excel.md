Most people track the wrong number. They watch their account balance. They celebrate a paycheck. They panic when a bill arrives. But the number that actually predicts your financial future — the one that tells you whether you're building wealth or just treading water — is your **savings rate**.

Here's what it is, how to calculate it, and how to track it month by month in Excel.

## What Is a Savings Rate?

Your savings rate is the percentage of your income that you save (or use to pay down debt) instead of spending.

The formula is simple:

```
Savings Rate = (Amount Saved ÷ Gross Income) × 100
```

If you earn $5,000 per month and save $500, your savings rate is **10%**.

If you earn $5,000 per month and save $1,500, your savings rate is **30%**.

Two people can earn the same salary and have completely different financial trajectories based on this single number. The person saving 30% will reach financial independence years — sometimes decades — before the person saving 10%.

## Why It Matters More Than Your Income

Income gets all the attention. "I got a raise." "They make six figures." "I'm underpaid." But income without savings rate is a revolving door.

There are people earning $150,000 a year with zero savings and people earning $45,000 with a 25% savings rate who are quietly building serious wealth. The difference isn't what they make — it's what they keep.

Your savings rate determines:
- **How many years until you can retire** (or become financially independent)
- **How resilient you are to financial shocks** (job loss, medical bills, car repairs)
- **How fast your net worth grows** regardless of your salary

A commonly cited benchmark: at a 50% savings rate, you can retire in roughly 17 years — regardless of income level. At a 10% savings rate, it's closer to 40+ years.

## How to Calculate Yours in Excel

You don't need a complicated spreadsheet. You need three columns and five minutes.

**Step 1: Open a new Excel sheet**

Label your columns:
- Column A: Month
- Column B: Gross Income (total before taxes/deductions)
- Column C: Total Saved (contributions to savings, retirement, debt paydown)
- Column D: Savings Rate (formula column)

**Step 2: Enter your income and savings**

For income, use your gross pay — before taxes. Some people prefer to use take-home pay (net income). Either works, just be consistent. Gross gives you a more realistic picture of your total financial picture. Net is more intuitive for day-to-day planning.

For savings, count:
- Money transferred to savings accounts
- 401(k) and IRA contributions (including employer match)
- Extra debt payments above the minimum
- Any invested money (brokerage, index funds, etc.)

Do **not** count minimum debt payments as savings. Those are obligations. Only extra payments count.

**Step 3: Add the formula**

In column D:
```excel
=(C2/B2)*100
```

Format it as a number with one decimal place. Now you see your savings rate as a percentage.

**Step 4: Add a goal line**

Create a cell somewhere on the sheet — call it your target. Put your goal savings rate there (10%, 20%, 25%, whatever you're aiming for). Then add a conditional formatting rule to column D:

- Green if the savings rate is at or above goal
- Red if it's below

Now you have a monthly savings rate tracker with a visual target. You'll see exactly which months you hit your goal and which ones slipped.

## What's a Good Savings Rate?

**Below 10%:** Survival mode. You're covering expenses but building little cushion. One bad month can undo progress. Focus on cutting expenses or increasing income before anything else.

**10-15%:** The minimum viable savings rate for long-term stability. At this level, you're moving forward — slowly. You'll retire eventually, but it'll take the full 40 years.

**15-20%:** Solid. You're building real momentum. Debt goes down. Net worth goes up. You start having options.

**20-30%:** Above average. You're compressing your timeline significantly. Shocks don't destroy your plans.

**30%+:** You're operating like someone who's serious about financial independence. At this rate, you're probably 10-15 years from having a real choice about whether to work.

The benchmarks are guides, not verdicts. Going from 0% to 8% is a bigger win than going from 25% to 30%. Start where you are. Improve over time.

## The Monthly Review Habit

A savings rate tracker only works if you actually look at it. Build a 10-minute monthly habit:

1. On the first of the month, enter last month's income and savings totals
2. Check your savings rate
3. Ask one question: "Did I hit my goal? If not, why not?"
4. Adjust one thing for this month

That's it. No complex budgeting system. No 45-category expense tracker. Just one number, once a month, with one question.

Over time, you'll start to see patterns. Tax months are rough. Holiday spending hits savings in December. Quarterly expenses (car insurance, subscriptions) spike certain months. When you see the patterns, you can plan for them.

## The Savings Rate Mindset Shift

Most people budget from expenses backward: income minus expenses equals whatever is left, and that's the savings. This is why most people save almost nothing — there's rarely anything left.

Flip it. Decide your savings rate first. Set up an automatic transfer on payday. Then live on what remains. This is "pay yourself first" — and it's the most reliable way to actually build wealth.

If your current savings rate is zero, start with 3%. If it's 5%, try 8%. The goal is a sustainable improvement, not a punishing sprint.

Your savings rate is a dial, not a switch. Turn it up gradually. Let the compounding do the work.

## Build the Tracker, Use It Once a Month

You can build this savings rate tracker in under 10 minutes in Excel. Four columns, a simple formula, conditional formatting for color coding. That's the whole system.

The tracker at [FinanceCraftedSheets](https://www.etsy.com/shop/FinanceCraftedSheets) includes a savings rate calculator alongside net worth tracking if you want a pre-built version. But the one you build yourself — and actually open every month — is worth more than any template you download and forget.

One number. Monthly check-in. Consistent upward trend. That's the playbook.
