Everyone knows “minimum payments are bad,” but few people can tell you **how** bad.  
Today we fix that. We’re cracking open the spreadsheet, running the math on **real APRs** (18–25 %), and showing you precisely what those tiny minimum payments do to your wallet — and your life.

Grab your coffee. This one’s going to hurt.

## What “18 % APR” Actually Means

Credit-card interest is **compounded daily**.

> Daily Periodic Rate = APR ÷ 365  
> 18 % ÷ 365 ≈ 0.0493 % per day  
> 25 % ÷ 365 ≈ 0.0685 % per day

Every single day you let a balance sit, the issuer adds that percentage to what you owe. Tomorrow, you pay interest on **today’s interest**. That’s the magic that makes debt snowballs roll downhill — except they’re rolling **over you**.

## The Minimum-Payment Trap

Most issuers calculate the minimum as **1 % of balance + interest + fees**, with a floor of **$25–$35**.  
Sounds reasonable, right? Let’s look at two real balances.

### Scenario 1 – $3,000 @ 18 % APR

- **Minimum**: 1 % of balance + interest, floor $25  
- **Starting payment**: ≈ $75  
- **Time to payoff**: **18 years 4 months**  
- **Total interest paid**: **$3,923** — **more than the original balance**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Original balance | $3,000 |
| Total paid | $6,923 |
| Interest cost | $3,923 (131 % of original) |

### Scenario 2 – $8,000 @ 25 % APR

- **Minimum**: starts around $200, declines slowly  
- **Time to payoff**: **31 years 6 months**  
- **Total interest paid**: **$19,263**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Original balance | $8,000 |
| Total paid | $27,263 |
| Interest cost | $19,263 (241 % of original) |

If you only ever paid minimums, that $8 k vacation would literally follow you into retirement.

## What Happens If You Pay “A Little Extra”?

Let’s keep the same $3,000 @ 18 % but add **just $50** to the first payment (so $125 instead of $75) and keep all future payments at **$125 fixed**.

- **Time to payoff**: **2 years 9 months**  
- **Total interest**: **$682**

One extra Jackson per month saves you **15½ years** and **$3,241** in interest.

| Strategy | Payoff Time | Interest | Savings |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Minimum only | 18 y 4 m | $3,923 | — |
| Fixed $125/mo | 2 y 9 m | $682 | **$3,241** |

## Aggressive Payoff: $500/mo Example

Throw $500 at the same $3 k balance:

- **Time to payoff**: **7 months**  
- **Total interest**: **$183**

You just bought yourself a 17-year, $3,740 raise.

## Debt Avalanche vs. Debt Snowball

Now that you’re revved up, **how do you attack multiple cards**?

### Avalanche (Mathematically Superior)

1. List every balance and APR.  
2. Pay **minimums on everything**.  
3. Throw **every extra dollar** at the **highest APR** until it’s gone.  
4. Roll the freed-up payment to the next-highest APR.  

**Pros**: Least interest, fastest overall payoff.  
**Cons**: Psychological wins come later.

### Snowball (Behavioral Powerhouse)

1. List balances **smallest to largest** (ignore APR).  
2. Pay **minimums on everything**.  
3. Attack the **smallest balance first**.  
4. Roll the freed-up payment to the next balance.

**Pros**: Quick wins keep motivation high.  
**Cons**: You’ll pay slightly more interest.

### Which Should You Pick?

If you trust yourself to stick with the plan, **avalanche** saves money. If you’ve failed at debt plans before, **snowball** builds momentum. Both destroy the minimum-payment hamster wheel.

## How to Find the Extra Money

- **Gig it**: One weekend DoorDash shift = $80–$100 → knocks months off a payoff.  
- **Sell clutter**: Facebook Marketplace your old electronics; dump proceeds straight at the balance.  
- **Cut a subscription**: $15/month Spotify Family plan? Pause it for six months, save $90 in interest.

Every $1 you throw at high-interest debt today is **$2–$3** you don’t pay tomorrow.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Minimum payments maximize bank profit**, not your freedom.  
2. **Compound interest on debt is the inverse of investing** — it grows fastest when you ignore it.  
3. Adding even **a small fixed amount** slashes years and thousands off your payoff.  
4. **Pick either avalanche or snowball** — what matters is attacking one balance with intensity.

## Action Steps This Week

1. **Log in to every card**, screenshot the current balance and APR.  
2. Use an online avalanche or snowball calculator (I like undebt.it).  
3. **Schedule an automatic payment** $50–$100 above the minimum on your target card.  
4. Set a calendar reminder in 90 days to celebrate the new, lower balance.

Debt doesn’t fade; it’s **paid or compounded**. Choose today which side of that line you’re on.
