I bought a 2020 Dodge Charger Scat Pack in January 2023 because the V8 rumble made my lizard brain happy. Five minutes after signing, I realized **$47,312** at **18.24 % APR** for 72 months was a financial choke-hold. That’s about **$7,700 in interest** the first year alone if I only paid the minimum of **$1,088**.  

I’m not letting a car steal six figures from my future. Here’s the exact plan I’m running right now to kill the loan by July 2026 instead of January 2029, saving **$18,430** in interest.

## 1. The Numbers, Straight Up

| Item | Figure |
|---|---|
| Original balance | $47,312.00 |
| APR | 18.24 % |
| Minimum payment | $1,088.51 |
| Term (original) | 72 months |
| Months left (if I did nothing) | 55 |
| **Months I’ll actually take** | 42 |

## 2. Extra Payment Formula I Use

I send **two** extra chunks every month:

1. Automatic **$400** principal-only payment from every bi-weekly W-2 paycheck (=$800/mo).
2. **$1,200–$1,500** from DoorDash + weekend detailing gigs, paid the day the money hits my account.

That’s **$2,000–$2,300** extra per month on top of the $1,088 minimum.  
Every extra cent hits **principal only** — I triple-check the payment memo to keep the lender from “helpfully” prepaying future interest.

## 3. How Much Interest I’m Torching

Amortization math (I ran both Excel and undebt.it):

| Scenario | Total Interest | Payoff Date |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum only | **$28,064** | Jan 2029 |
| With extra $2,150/mo | **$9,634** | **July 2026** |
| Interest saved | **$18,430** | — |

$18k is a Roth IRA max-out plus change. I’ll take it.

## 4. Month-by-Month Payoff Timeline

| Month | Payment (Min+Extra) | Ending Balance |
|---|---|---|
| May 2024 | $3,238 | $41,471 |
| Aug 2024 | $3,238 | $34,205 |
| Nov 2024 | $3,238 | $26,798 |
| Feb 2025 | $3,238 | $19,242 |
| May 2025 | $3,238 | $11,527 |
| Aug 2025 | $3,238 | $3,640 |
| **Jul 2026** | **$1,088** | **$0** |

(Exact cents vary by lender posting schedule; I update the sheet every two weeks.)

## 5. Where the Extra Cash Comes From

| Source | Avg Monthly Net |
|---|---|
| DoorDash (Fri/Sat nights) | $950 |
| Mobile car detailing (2–3 cars/weekend) | $800 |
| Plasma donations (2×/week) | $180 |
| **Total** | **$1,930** |

I keep a separate checking account nicknamed **“Kill the Charger.”** Every gig dollar lands there and is auto-swept to the loan within 24 hrs. Out of sight, out of mind, out of debt.

---

## 6. The Rules I Follow So I Don’t Quit

- **No lifestyle creep.** I meal-prep rice + chicken and brew cheap coffee. The car already ate my budget.
- **Weekly balance text.** I set an IFTTT applet that texts me the loan balance every Monday. Watching it shrink is the dopamine hit.
- **One guilt-free spend.** $50/month goes into a “fun” envelope. Keeps me sane without nuking the plan.

---

## 7. What Happens After

Once the title is in my hand:

1. Redirect the entire $3,238/mo to max out Roth IRA + HSA.
2. Bump emergency fund from $3k to $10k.
3. Sell the Charger, buy a $10k Corolla in cash. (Yeah, I’ll miss the V8, but 35 mpg and no payment tastes better.)

---

## TL;DR

I’m throwing **every extra dollar** at a $47k, 18 % car loan, cutting the payoff from 55 months to 42 and saving **$18,430** in interest. Side hustles + automation + zero mercy is the entire playbook. If you’re stuck in a high-interest auto note, copy the math and start tonight. The rumble in your ears is cool; the rumble of compound interest is louder.
