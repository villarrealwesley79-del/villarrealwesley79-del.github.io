## Habit #1: "I'll Budget Next Month" Mentality

More than 60% of Americans don't track spending consistently. This leads to:
- Overspending on non-essentials
- Missed bill payments
- No emergency savings

### Fix: Create a Maintenance Budget
Set aside 15 minutes weekly to:
1. Review major purchases
2. Adjust category limits
3. Update savings goals

Use our [automated budget tracker](https://financecraftedsheets.etsy.com/listing/4455592837) to make updates painless.

## Habit #2: Impulse Buying "Treats"

Those $50-200 purchases add up:
- Weekly lunch out: $100/month
- Spontaneous Amazon buys: $150/month
- Unused subscriptions: $50/month

### Fix: The 30-Day Rule
1. Add desired items to a "Maybe" list
2. Wait 30 days
3. If still wanted, purchase

Track these in our [spending journal template](https://financecraftedsheets.etsy.com/listing/4455592837) with a "Pending" column.

## Habit #3: Mixing Checking Accounts

Using one account for everything causes:
- Overdraft fees
- Poor spending visibility
- Difficulty tracking goals

### Fix: Implement the Envelope System
Create virtual accounts:
1. Main Checking
2. Bills & Essentials
3. Fun Money
4. Savings Vaults

Our [multi-account budget template](https://financecraftedsheets.etsy.com/listing/4455592837) automates transfers between these.

## Habit #4: Ignoring Small Debts

"I'll pay it off eventually" thinking costs thousands:
| Debt | Balance | APR | Monthly Payment | Years to Payoff | Total Interest |
|------|---------|-----|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Credit Card | $3,000 | 18% | $60 | 6.5 | $2,230 |

### Fix: Debt Avalanche Method
1. List debts from highest to lowest interest
2. Make minimum payments on all
3. Attack highest-rate debt first

Use our [debt payoff calculator](https://financecraftedsheets.etsy.com/listing/4455592837) to create a custom plan.

## Habit #5: DIY Financial Planning

Spreadsheets that are:
- Too complex to maintain
- Missing key formulas
- Not connected to goals

### Fix: Use Purpose-Built Tools
Our [financial template bundle](https://financecraftedsheets.etsy.com/listing/4455592837) includes:
- Debt trackers with payoff calculators
- Net worth dashboards
- Goal-based savings planners

## Bottom Line

Breaking these habits takes time but pays huge dividends. Start with small changes:
1. Pick 1 habit to fix this month
2. Implement the fix using our templates
3. Review progress in 30 days

Your future self will thank you for making these shifts today.
