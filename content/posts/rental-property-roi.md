Most real estate investors I talk to use one of two methods to evaluate deals:

1. Gross Rent Multiplier (basically a guess with numbers)
2. "I feel good about this property"

Neither is a plan. Both are how people lose money.

A rental property isn't an investment just because rent goes in every month. You need to know if the math actually works for your situation.

## The Problem With Gross Rent Multiplier

Gross Rent Multiplier says: if the annual rent is $24,000 and the purchase price is $200,000, your GRM is 8.3.

Lower GRM = better deal. That's it. That's the analysis.

Except it tells you nothing about:
- Your actual monthly cash flow (the amount you keep)
- Loan terms and what your payment actually is
- Property taxes and insurance (varies wildly by location)
- Vacancy rate (what if the place sits empty for three months?)
- Maintenance reserves (things break)
- Your equity building from principal paydown
- Your actual return on the money you put down

A property with an 8.3 GRM could be a great deal or a horrible deal depending on everything GRM ignores.

You need real metrics.

## The Numbers You Need First

Before you even look at a calculator, gather these:

**Purchase and financing:**
- Purchase price
- Down payment amount (and what % that is)
- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Loan term (15, 30 years)
- Closing costs (usually 2-5% of price)

**Income:**
- Expected monthly rent (based on actual market rents, not what the seller says)
- Any other income (laundry, parking, etc.)

**Expenses:**
- Property taxes (annual, then monthly)
- Insurance (annual, then monthly)
- HOA fees if applicable
- Maintenance reserve (1-2% of property value annually is standard)
- Vacancy assumption (5-10% of annual rent is typical)
- Property management (8-12% of rent if you're not managing it yourself)
- Utilities you cover (some owners cover water/trash)

**Your situation:**
- Tax bracket (for calculating tax benefits)
- How long you plan to hold the property
- Other properties you own (debt service coverage requirements)

If the deal doesn't have these numbers, it's not a real analysis.

## Cap Rate: The Foundation

Cap rate is net operating income divided by purchase price.

**Cap Rate = NOI ÷ Purchase Price**

NOI is your annual rent minus annual operating expenses (not including the mortgage).

Example:
- Monthly rent: $2,000 ($24,000/year)
- Monthly property taxes: $150 ($1,800/year)
- Monthly insurance: $100 ($1,200/year)
- Maintenance reserve: $300/month ($3,600/year)
- Vacancy assumption: 5% = $1,200/year
- Property management: 10% = $2,400/year

Total annual operating expenses: $10,200

NOI = $24,000 - $10,200 = $13,800

If you paid $200,000 for this property:
Cap Rate = $13,800 ÷ $200,000 = 6.9%

What's good? It varies by market. Urban markets might be 3-5%. Smaller markets might be 6-10%. Higher cap rate = higher risk usually (but not always).

A 6.9% cap rate is decent but not amazing. You could probably get 6-7% in the stock market with less risk.

## Cash-on-Cash Return: What You Actually Keep

This matters more than cap rate because it's what hits your bank account.

**Cash-on-Cash Return = Annual Cash Flow ÷ Cash Invested**

Using the same property, your mortgage payment might be $1,100/month ($13,200/year).

Monthly cash flow = $2,000 rent - $150 taxes - $100 insurance - $300 maintenance - $200 management = $1,250/month

That's not $1,250 actual cash. Your mortgage payment comes out, so actual cash you keep = $1,250 - $1,100 = $150/month.

Annual cash flow = $1,800

If you put $50,000 down (25% down payment), your cash-on-cash return is:
$1,800 ÷ $50,000 = 3.6%

That's ... not great. You could get 3.6% in a savings account without the headache of tenants, maintenance calls, and being a landlord.

This is why location and price matter. In a cheaper market, you might get $2,000 rent on a $120,000 purchase (20% down = $24,000). Now cash-on-cash could be 8-10%.

## Debt Service Coverage Ratio

Banks care about this. You should too.

**DSCR = NOI ÷ Debt Service (annual mortgage payment)**

Banks typically want 1.25 or higher. That means NOI is 25% higher than your mortgage payment.

Using the example:
- NOI: $13,800
- Mortgage payment: $1,100/month = $13,200/year
- DSCR: $13,800 ÷ $13,200 = 1.045

That's below 1.25. A bank might not finance this, and if they do, you're underwater immediately if rent drops or something breaks.

This is a red flag metric. If DSCR is below 1.2, you're betting on appreciation, not cash flow.

## The Excel Calculator You Actually Need

Create a spreadsheet with:

**Input section (top, easy to change):**
- Purchase price
- Down payment %
- Interest rate
- Loan term
- Monthly rent
- All monthly expenses

**Calculated section:**
- Loan amount
- Monthly payment
- Annual NOI
- Cap rate
- Cash-on-cash return
- DSCR
- 5-year and 10-year projections

Change the rent up or down 10%. What happens to cash flow? Good investors ask "what if rent drops?" not "what if rent stays perfect?"

Raise expense assumptions by 20%. Realistic maintenance costs? Good. Still profitable? If not, the deal's too thin.

## Scenario Analysis: The Deal Killer

Here's what breaks deals:

**Scenario 1: Vacancy hits 10% instead of 5%**
That's an extra $1,200/year lost. On a $150/month cash flow, that's 8 months of rent gone. Suddenly you're negative.

**Scenario 2: Maintenance costs 2% instead of 1% of property value**
On a $200,000 property, that's an extra $2,000/year. Your $1,800 annual cash flow turns into a $200 loss.

**Scenario 3: Interest rates spike and refinance isn't an option**
Less relevant if you're paying cash, but matters if you plan to borrow later.

If any of these scenarios tank the deal, it's not a good enough deal. You need deals that work even when things go wrong.

## The Numbers That Tell You to Walk Away

**Pass if:**
- Cash-on-cash return is below 5% (you can do better elsewhere)
- DSCR is below 1.2 (too risky)
- Cap rate is below 4% (you're betting on appreciation, not cash flow)
- Monthly cash flow is negative or below $200 after all expenses
- You're only making money if rent appreciates (that's speculating, not investing)

## Building Long-Term Wealth With Real Estate

The real ROI on rental properties is:
1. Monthly cash flow (even if it's small)
2. Principal paydown (the mortgage gets paid down every year)
3. Appreciation (if it happens)
4. Tax benefits (depreciation, deductions)

If you buy right, all four work together. If you're only relying on one, the deal's probably weak.

## The Complete Analysis Template

Pull together: purchase price, down payment, loan details, rent estimate, all expenses, your tax bracket, holding period.

Build the spreadsheet once. Plug in numbers for each property. This takes 30 minutes per deal.

If it doesn't look good in a spreadsheet, it won't look good in reality.
