Reselling is one of the fastest-growing side hustles — eBay, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace, and thrift flipping together generated over $200B in 2025. But most resellers leave money on the table. They underprice items, forget what they paid for things, and can't tell you at the end of the month whether they actually made a profit.

The fix is a spreadsheet. Here's how to set one up and how to use it.

## Who's Succeeding in Reselling

The most profitable niches by platform:

- **eBay**: Electronics, collectibles, vintage tech — high search volume, national buyer pool
- **Poshmark**: Fashion, designer goods, luxury accessories — 30% seller fees but massive audience
- **Facebook Marketplace**: Furniture, appliances, baby gear — local pickup eliminates shipping
- **Thrift Flipping**: Vintage clothing, branded sportswear — low cost basis, high upside

What separates profitable resellers from break-even resellers isn't sourcing — it's tracking. If you don't know your cost basis, you can't know your margin.

## Why Most Resellers Lose Money Without Knowing It

Here's what goes untracked:

- **Holding costs**: Storage, boxes, tape, printer ink — roughly $5/month per unsold item
- **Platform fees**: eBay takes 12-15%, Poshmark takes 20%, Mercari takes 10% + shipping
- **Return rates**: Average 15-30% depending on category. Returns eat your profit fast.
- **Time**: If it takes 2 hours to source, clean, photograph, list, and ship an item that nets $8, you made $4/hour.

None of this shows up in your PayPal balance. It only shows up in a spreadsheet.

## Building Your Inventory Tracker

### Essential Columns

At minimum, every item in your inventory should have:

| Column | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Item ID | Links to photos, receipts, location |
| Purchase Date | Tracks holding time |
| Description | Searchable when you need to find something |
| Cost Basis | What you paid, including shipping to you |
| Platform | Where you're selling it |
| Platform Fee % | Varies by platform and category |
| Listed Price | What you're asking |
| Target Net Profit | What you actually keep after fees |
| Storage Location | Box number, shelf, bin |
| Status | Listed / Sold / Relisted / Donated |

### The Holding Cost Trap

Add a "Days Held" column and flag anything over 30 days. Items sitting in inventory for 60+ days are often better sold at a loss than held for a marginally better price. The math usually works out: an item that nets $15 today beats an item that nets $25 in 4 months after $20 in holding and relisting costs.

## Pricing for Profit

Most resellers price by feel. Here's the actual formula:

### Cost-Based Pricing Formula

```
Selling Price = (Cost Basis + Shipping Out) × (1 + Target Margin) ÷ (1 - Platform Fee %)
```

**Example**: You bought a dress for $20. Shipping out costs $5. You want a 50% margin. Poshmark takes 20%:
```
= (20 + 5) × 1.5 ÷ (1 - 0.20)
= 37.50 ÷ 0.80
= $46.88
```

You'd list at $47-48. Without this formula, most people would list at $40 and think they're making $15 — but they're really making $7 after fees.

### Dynamic Pricing by Condition

Build a pricing tier system:

- **Mint/New with tags**: 25% above comparable sold listings
- **Excellent**: Match the average of recent sold comps
- **Good**: 10-15% below average
- **As-Is/For Parts**: 30-40% below average, price to move fast

### Platform Fee Reference

| Platform | Fee Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| eBay | 12-15% | Varies by category |
| Poshmark | 20% flat | Plus shipping label |
| Mercari | 10% + 3% payment | More predictable |
| Facebook Marketplace | 5% shipped | Free for local pickup |

## Slow-Moving Inventory Strategy

Set an alert for items held over 30 days:

1. **Day 31**: Drop price 10%
2. **Day 45**: Drop price another 10%, cross-list to another platform
3. **Day 60**: Consider bundling with other slow items
4. **Day 90**: Donate or sell in a lot — get the space back

Sitting inventory has a cost. Treat it that way.

## Real-World Numbers

| Item | Cost | Listed | Sold | Fees | Net Profit | Days Held |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| iPhone 15 Pro | $450 | $720 | $695 | $90 | $155 | 14 |
| Vintage Levi's | $8 | $85 | $72 | $18 | $46 | 22 |
| KitchenAid Mixer | $35 | $220 | $195 | $25 | $135 | 9 |
| Nike Dunk Low | $120 | $180 | $162 | $24 | $18 | 31 |

Notice the Nikes — bought for $120, sold for $162, made $18 after fees. Without tracking, that feels like a win. With tracking, you know it underperformed your 40% target margin and you'd source differently next time.

## Key Takeaways

1. Track cost basis from the moment you buy — not when you list
2. Use the pricing formula every time, not feel
3. Platform fees are higher than most resellers account for
4. Flag slow-moving inventory at 30 days and act on it
5. At the end of each month, total your net profit — if you can't, your tracking is broken
